Installing RedNotebook from source on macOS
===========================================

(many thanks to Peter Green for documenting this at

Of the three mac installation methods listed on the Rednotebook downloads page, these got the closest:
https://jarrousse.org/installing-rednotebook-from-source-on-mac-os-x/

Here's a summary of modified steps ...

$ git clone https://github.com/jendrikseipp/rednotebook
$ brew install gtk # <= using brew to install gtk worked
$ brew install pygobject3 glib libffi cairo gtksourceview3
$ brew install atk librsvg # <= don't install gdk-pixbuf at this step
$ brew install gsettings-desktop-schemas adwaita-icon-theme
$ brew install enchant
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
$ cd ~/path/to/rednotebook
$ pip3 install --user .

In Automator (run as bash shell script) ...

export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
/Users/me/path/rednotebook
