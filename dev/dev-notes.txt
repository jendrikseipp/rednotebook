====== Development notes ======

O WYSIWYG as an alternative to markup???
  notes:
    2 options: Save in html or txt2tags format
    HTML Editing: Webkit
    HTML Saving: Webkit
    HTML2txt2tags: Vim Script (port to python), https://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=29588583
    HTML2markdown: python module exists
    HTML2Latex: Use HTML2txt2tags2Latex (write or use twisted lore)
    HTML2PDF: xhtml2pdf, http://code.activestate.com/recipes/532908/ possible, but only for plain text (no formatting)
              webkit is a better option here
    HTML2ODF: no suitable library at the moment. PyODF is buggy

O Encryption/Password
  - Save in password protected zipfiles (no open source tool to generate those)
    seems to be very easy to hack
  - Symmetric Encryption. AES (best method it seems)
        with PyCrypto
          http://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/,
          http://www.codekoala.com/blog/2009/aes-encryption-python-using-pycrypto/
          http://idsvandermolen.com/codefiles/crypto.py
          available in repos of all major distros
          ezpycrypto unneeded. mostly only simplifies key generation, ...
        Pure python AES module (check speed)
  - Truecrypt (Commandline): Would probably work, but requires installation of
    additional package that is not available in the repos

  --> Use pycrypto only

  - What should be encrypted? Files, Strings? -> Files better
    Lifeograph only writes to one file, encrypts a string

  - Maybe use only one file for a journal, add journal dependent variables
  - Maybe compress this file

  - AES uses fixed key-length -> bad for passwords -> use Blowfish with variable length
  - Blowfish faster than AES

  - Maybe just use 7z (only archive format that is widely known with good encryption (AES-256))
  - 7z can however also produce zip files with good encryption
  - For 7z package p7zip is needed (only supports 7z)
  - binary is called 7zr
  - Handling of extracted text files only in memory should be possible
    - What about pictures?

  - Maybe find a way to encrypt the whole directory

  - Best option seems to be 7z. Encrypt the texts and files in a lzma file and
    password protect it if needed. Use the command line instead of a library.

X Portable Version:
  Linux users can use the setting too, if all the computers have the RedNotebook
  requirements installed (pygtk, pyyaml)

  - Provide Option in Setup for running RedNotebook portable. Maybe use file
    that is only installed, when running this mode.

O Format:
  - JSON is faster to decode and encode and we only use strings and dicts
    anyway.

    The results for de-/encoding a typical example are on an HDD:
    * json_print      1.09020709991
    * pickle_print    0.710677146912
    * yaml_print      4.67402696609 -> we already get 2x fast
    * cyaml_print     1.96824002266 -> json 2x as fast
    * json_read       0.253901958466
    * pickle_read     0.15873003006
    * yaml_read       1.24900007248 -> json 5x as fast
    * cyaml_read      ?

    SSD:
    * json_print      1.16
    * cjson_print     0.16
    * ujson_print     0.13
    * cyaml_print     0.87
    * json_read       0.18
    * cjson_read      0.10
    * ujson_read      0.06
    * cyaml_read      0.69

    However, the format is more verbose and requires more syntax.

O Left-over files:
  - %APPDATA%\gtk-2.0\gtkfilechooser.ini: Gone in GTK+3
  - %USERPROFILE%\.gtk-bookmarks: Still present in GTK+3
  - WebpageIcons.db can probably be disabled in future webkitgtk versions with
    webkit_icon_database.set_path(None)

O Mobile version:
  - Kivy (No calendar widget, but probably simple next/prev day navigation is better anyway)
    - Has ReST renderer (txt2tags->ReST->Rendering)
    - Vite vite project for business widgets
  - Qt for android (http://thp.io/2011/pyside-android/)
  - Django
  - Google App Engine
  - Heroku
  - jQuery Mobile
  - Sencha Touch
  - HTML5 + CSS3 + JS
    - Phonegap (Access low-level features)
    - Dojo Mobile (Native themes) vs. jQuery Mobile (Non-native theme)
      --> jQuery Mobile seems to be more qidely adopted and easier.
    - Modernizr for detecting browser support
    - Supports all mobile platforms and is even compatible with the Windows Store

O Markdown:
  - Parsing would need a PEG parser
  - Allow some common markdown syntax:
    - Asterisks (*) for lists
    - Allow triple {{{ and }}} in addition to ``` for code.
  - docutils could be extended for t2t

O Use Zeitgeist for automatic category entries
  O Make Zeitgeist widget generic, so it can be reused by other projects
  X Music tracks or albums (Wrote decibel zeitgeist addon, addons for other players available)
  X Movies
  X Web History (Firefox addon written by zeitgeist devs)
  X Documents, Pictures
  O Mails (Write Thunderbird zeitgeist addon)
  X Twitter Messages (gwibber zeitgeist addon written by zeitgeist devs)

O Windows Store:
  - Annual cost 37 Euro (personal) or 75 Euro (company)
  - Company account needed for desktop apps
  - Certification is required also for desktop apps

O Syntax highlighting:
  - highlight.js via http://cdnjs.com/ or http://softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en/download/
  - Alternatives: prettify.js, SyntaxHighlighter


Ideas:

Have a viewable panel with a sort of tree-like structure,
that shows every single entry I've ever added, somewhat similar to how windows
folders are organised, but with a top level directory for each year, a sublevel
with months, and an entry level.. with a plus/minus option to display, or not,
each year/month and maybe a count next to each year/month, so we can quickly
and easily see how many entries were made each year/month. This would be a
great addition to the calendar method already available.

Implementation notes:
- PyYAML saves each string as ascii if it only contains ascii chars.
  If there are unicode chars, a unicode object is saved.
- The Days always turn their text into unicode before returning it.
