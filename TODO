TODO / Roadmap:

If you have any suggestions or comments, feel free to contact me on the
mailing list or directly per mail. Before starting to work on a feature,
please check back with me briefly about its status.


=== Roadmap ===

X Use new CDN link for MathJax.
O Place subtags behind hashtags inside the text itself:
  I met #Sarah and we had some coffee talking about old times# then i went to #work.
  Maybe it's better to use #Movies:Oblivion and end the subtag at the end of the line.
X Insert Latex formulas (LP:851471)
  X Preview Latex formulas
  X Highlight formulas in edit mode
  X Support formulas in all exports
  X Add menu item for inserting formulas
X Tables
  X Highlight tables in edit mode
X Numbered lists
X Add quotes by indenting them with a tab
O Make default css prettier
O Scroll to searched text when a result is clicked in preview mode (seems difficult in webkitgtk)
O When clicking on a hashtag in the tag cloud scroll to tag and highlight it (seems difficult with webkitgtk)
O Allow filtering days that contain multiple given tags, allow iteratively clicking more tags.
O Exports: add option to insert a page break between days. Use hr for
  HTML exports. This seems to be difficult for PDFs.
O Macro system that takes predefined text like {weather} and turns it
  into other text for the preview, e.g. an HTML snippet that displays that day's weather symbol.
O Live preview of selected font in editor pane.
O Allow exporting the entries of a search result.
O When searching for a tag, show text near tag in search results.
O Allow searching for hashtags and show subhashtags in the search results
O Make sure that RedNotebook contents are saved under Windows when system is shut down.
O Make sure there is no race condition between automatic and manual saving that could cause data corruption.
O When searching for a tag, show text around tag, not beginning of day's text.
O Search: Wrap or overlay search results to make more text visible.
O Disable automatic switch between edit and preview mode by default.
O Copy files and pictures into data subdirectory
O Internal links to other days

Right-side tags panel:
  O Make the right panel an advanced option?
  O Remove tag panel.
    O Make sure that inline tags allow subtags and that these are
      displayed when searching for the tag.
    O Allow formatting subtags (--groceries--).

O Enable right-click menu for copying in preview
  We don't want the menu with "Reload", so we can either
  - Create our own menu
    - Complicated
  - Only show the menu if there's a selection
    - WebView.has_selection() seems to be broken

O Non-code:
  O Add testimonials to homepage.
  O Make help file available online to let search engines index it.
  O Update screenshots on homepage.

O Imports
  X RedNotebook Backup zipfile
  X RedNotebook data directory
  X Plain text files
  X Tomboy (remove again?)
  O It's probably best to supply scripts for converting other sources like Evernote, Wordpress, ics (used by Google Calendar).

O Custom-style journals? (Allow custom css files for preview rendering, e.g. mono-space, white text on black bg, margins)
O Translate help (Restructure first using Sphinx?)
O Possibility to show all entries (Search for "*" or show all entries if no text has been entered)
O Search and replace (useful for renaming categories and other names)
  (Add replace functionality after search has been entered)
O Add per-journal configuration?
  O Per-journal fonts and size

Windows:
O Make windows installer truly portable (leave no traces in registry)
  Probably it's better to distribute a zip archive for this.

New format:
O Use json instead of yaml (wait till after port to Python 3)?
O Use standard paths? (Win: C:\Docs & Settings\username\My Documents,
  Linux: ~/.local/share, ~/.config (http://live.gnome.org/Tomboy/Directories))



=== Maybe even some of these features will make it into RedNotebook ===

O Automatic insertion of photo links for current day (use zeitgeist or tracker to search hard-disk for photos)
O Plugin system?
O Improve startup time by showing the window and doing the rest of the
  initialization afterwards.
O Preferenes window: use separate page and textarea instead of textbox for black- and white list?
O Color submenu in format menu with additional color picker and color highlighting in edit mode



=== Features that will **not** be implemented ===

- ``monospaced`` (we only want one font)
- verbatim / raw ( """/"" - supported, undocumented) (too confusing / poorly behaving)
- remote pictures (pictures would have to be downloaded and saved in a folder for exports)
- dataDir Lock (for multiple TRN instances) (unneeded)
- Tags in text entries (e.g. @film:Batman) (KISS)
- Copy/Paste category entries (Too complicated)
- Add --portable command line parameter (The default config file is better)
- word wrapping while editing category entries (too complicated, would involve writing C code)
- Language selection for spell checking (is already implemented in new versions of gtkspell)
- Todo tab next to clouds (KISS)
- Automatic Backups (KISS, intruding, gentle messages are better)
- Rethink linebreaks? (Changing paragraphs in txt2tags will probably crash
  everything, Current behaviour should be fine)
- allow opening config file from within RedNotebook
  (Probably no good idea as some options might be unavailable or confusing)
- Make the Format button remember its last action -> No, current behaviour good enough.
- Tabs for different notebooks (KISS)
- Add option for time interval between automatic savings? (KISS)
- Let user select the language for RedNotebook in Windows installer (User wants his win language)
- Get proper file layout with one script not part of module (Everything works without name clashes)
- Use threads for file loading and link opening (Probably a bad idea since threads are a source of errors)
- List recently opened journals under "Journal" -> "Recently Used" (KISS, config option needed)
- Drag and Drop for Windows (gtk inter application dnd isn't implemented on win32)
- Use configobj for config files (KISS, Never change A running system ;)
- Search for multiple words at the same time (KISS)
- For each journal to have its own templates (KISS)
- Let the Search type selection remember the selection between sessions (KISS)
- Let the Annotate and Tag window box remember their positions between sessions (KISS)
- Select template file when clicking the button instead of adding weekday's file
- Use categories for number data and present it graphically (KMs, Cash, Calories) (KISS)
- Check for duplicates in cloud blacklists (Does not make much sense since each word
  can only be right-clicked once in the cloud)
- Right-click on word in main text area to add it to cloud whitelist
  (Functionality will be difficult to find, would have to be implemented for
  preview as well)
- Image resizing with PIL (The width parameter is more useful)
- Use attributes for formatting glade strings for easier translation
  (requires gtk+-2.16 and does not make much sense now that all strings have been translated)
- Move the "update application" command into the help menu (central place for the checking is better)
- Use a custom config.t2t per diary (https://sourceforge.net/apps/phpbb/rednotebook/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=126)
  (This will be overkill for most users and having a data subdirectory for images etc. will suffice)
- Open the exported file after the export? (No other program does that)
- Monitor clipboard and add all copied stuff into RedNotebook in "clip mode" (unintuitive, KISS)
- Generalize tags to "hierarchical tags" (This is the job of outliners)
- Add additional one-click menu (like the one with Search and Tags Cloud) that
  contains quick links to other journals
  (https://sourceforge.net/apps/phpbb/rednotebook/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=23) (KISS)
- Syntaxhighlighting support (pygments) (KISS, can probably be done with javascript)
- Support for 'inline files': read content from file upon preview of page and
  add the contents of the file inline (which allows for 'dynamic' content) (KISS)
- Field or shortcut to enter a date and takes you there (One navigation suffices)
- Disable cache for preview to support previewing externally changed files (Rarely used, might slowdown app)
- Use new markup for images: {/home/user/pic.png?50} (Too disruptive)
- Support %!include, %!preprocess, etc. (very txt2tags specific)
- Encryption (there are dedicated tools for encrypting files)
