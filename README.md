RedNotebook is a modern desktop journal. It lets you format, tag and
search your entries. You can also add pictures, links and customizable
templates, spell check your notes, and export to plain text, HTML,
Latex or PDF.

It is recommended to install RedNotebook with your package manager or
to download the Windows installer. Follow the steps below only if your
distribution has no RedNotebook package or you want to use a newer
RedNotebook version.

Install RedNotebook in the global `site-packages` directory and make
`rednotebook` command available globally:

    sudo apt-get install python3-pip
    # Change into RedNotebook directory.
    sudo pip3 install .

Install RedNotebook locally under
`~/.local/lib/python3.x/site-packages/` and create
`~/.local/bin/rednotebook` executable:

    sudo apt-get install python3-pip
    # Change into RedNotebook directory.
    pip3 install --user .
